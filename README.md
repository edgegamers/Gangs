# Gangs

This plugin allows players to create gangs (guilds / clubs / teams) and invite other players to join said gang.
From there, players are able to obtain currency (internal / default name is credits) and use it to purchase perks for
their gang.
Some example perks are:

- Colored Smokes
- Gang Chat
- Gang Name Displaying in Scoreboard / Chat

There is currently no configuration support, and only a MySQL database format has been tested (though, in theory, an
SQLite database could work).
